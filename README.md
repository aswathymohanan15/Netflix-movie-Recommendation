# Netflix-movie-Recommendation
This project is a movie recommendation system built using data science techniques. It helps users find similar Netflix shows or movies based on their preferences. The dataset includes information like show ID, type, title, director, country, description, and genres. We started by collecting and organizing this data to understand what kind of content is available on Netflix. Then, we performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns in the content.

Next, we cleaned the data using text preprocessing methods like tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization. We used TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text data into numerical format for better analysis. For building the recommendation system, we used cosine similarity to find shows with similar content. Based on this, the model suggests shows that are closely related to what the user has already watched. This project aims to improve the user experience by making personalized movie suggestions.
